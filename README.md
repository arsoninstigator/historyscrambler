# search history scrambler
I developed a Chrome extension designed to protect the privacy of individuals in situations where their internet activity is monitored, such as **women in abusive households**. The extension targets scenarios where even the slightest indication of seeking help—such as searches for domestic violence resources or escape plans—could trigger further harm. This tool specifically targets and **scrambles search queries related to seeking help** or exiting abusive situations. By replacing **sensitive search terms with benign queries** —like substituting "call the police" with "apple pie recipes"—it ensures that the search history appears innocuous. This provides a crucial layer of **digital protection without raising suspicion** since if an abuser reviews the browsing history, they won't find any indications of the individual's efforts to seek assistance or information on leaving the situation.
